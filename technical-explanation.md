# Technical explanation of GitHub signature verification issues

The main issue causing GitHub to report signatures as "invalid" was a mismatch between what was signed and what GitHub was verifying against.

## Problem Analysis

When comparing the verification payload from GitHub with our signed content, there were key discrepancies:

```
# What GitHub verified against (shown in your output):

committer Roberto Borges <roberto.borges@outlook.com> 1747786795 -0400

# What we signed (in our script):
author Roberto Borges <roberto.borges@outlook.com> 1747772395 -0400  # Different timestamp
committer Roberto Borges <roberto.borges@outlook.com> 1747772395 -0400
```

The timestamps don't match due to inconsistent conversions between date formats:

1. GitHub API provides dates in ISO 8601 format like "2025-05-21T00:19:55Z" 
2. Our script converted this to local time
3. During conversion between formats, the timezone adjustments led to different Unix timestamps
4. GitHub's verification expected the timestamps to match EXACTLY, but they didn't

## Solution Approach

The fixed script implements these key principles:

1. **Preserve GitHub API dates exactly**: Use the original ISO 8601 dates from GitHub in API requests
2. **Consistent UTC usage**: Always convert timestamps to UTC to avoid timezone issues
3. **Direct format conversion**: Convert from ISO 8601 to Git format without intermediary transformations
4. **Match Git payload precisely**: Ensure our signed content's timestamps are identical to what GitHub expects

When we sign a commit, GitHub looks for an EXACT match between what was signed and what it expects. Even a small difference in timestamp will invalidate the signature.

## Technical Implementation

The fixed script:
1. Saves the original date strings from GitHub API
2. Converts to UTC for Git timestamp format consistency
3. Preserves these formats consistently throughout the process
4. Uses the same exact timestamp values in both the signature and API payload

This ensures GitHub can verify our signatures correctly.
