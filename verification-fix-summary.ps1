# Quick summary of the changes made to fix GitHub signature verification

Write-Host "GitHub Commit Signature Verification Fix" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Write-Host "--------------------------------------" -ForegroundColor Cyan

Write-Host "`nThe original script had several issues preventing GitHub from verifying signatures:"
Write-Host "1. Timezone formatting inconsistencies between Git commit text and GitHub API"
Write-Host "2. Timestamp conversion errors between different formats"
Write-Host "3. Inconsistency in date format in the payload vs. what GitHub expected"

Write-Host "`nKey fixes implemented:" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host "1. Always use UTC (+0000) timestamps in commit text for consistency"
Write-Host "2. Preserve original GitHub date strings for the API payload"
Write-Host "3. Properly format the commit text with exact timestamp matching"
Write-Host "4. Ensure payload dates match exactly what GitHub expects"

Write-Host "`nTo apply these changes:" -ForegroundColor Yellow
Write-Host "1. The Set-GitHubSignCommit.ps1.fixed script contains all the fixes"
Write-Host "2. Copy it over the original script with:"
Write-Host "   Copy-Item -Path Set-GitHubSignCommit.ps1.fixed -Destination Set-GitHubSignCommit.ps1 -Force"
Write-Host "3. Then test with your token:"
Write-Host "   .\set-token.ps1 <your-github-token>"
Write-Host "   .\test-run.ps1"

Write-Host "`nThe key principle for GitHub signature verification is EXACT timestamp matching:"
Write-Host "- Use the EXACT same timestamps in Git commit format (Unix timestamp + timezone)"
Write-Host "- Use the EXACT same timestamps in GitHub API format (ISO 8601)" 
Write-Host "- Ensure Author and Committer timestamps are handled identically"

Write-Host "`nThe fixed script implements all these principles for verified signatures." -ForegroundColor Green
